# Setting up the BBB images

1. Download the latest BBB image from the RIAPS Wiki.

    [BBB Base Image -  June 12, 2018](https://riaps.isis.vanderbilt.edu/redmine/attachments/download/286/riaps-bbb-base-20180612.zip)

    ** NOTE: REMOVE THIS LINK BEFORE THIS REPOSITORY GOES PUBLIC!!!!! **

2. Copy the image to the BBB SD Card using a host machine and an SD Card reader.  A good open source tool for transferring the image to a SD Card is https://etcher.io/.

3. Put the SD Card into the BBB and boot it up.

4. Log into the **riaps** account on the BBB.

5. Add the RIAPS packages to the BBBs by using the following command (on the BBB).

```bash
./riaps_install_bbb.sh 2>&1 | tee install-bbb-riaps.log
```

6. You can ssh into the BBBs using the following:

    Username:  riaps<br/>
    Password:  riaps

```bash
ssh -i /home/riaps/.ssh/id_rsa.key riaps@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
```
>  where **xxx&#46;xxx&#46;xxx&#46;xxx** is the IP address of the BBB

<p align="center">or</p>

```bash
ssh -i /home/riaps/.ssh/id_rsa.key riaps@bbb-xxxx
```
> where **xxxx** is the hostname seen when logging into the BBBs

7. Secure communication between the Host Environment and the BBBs by following the [Securing Communication Between the VM and BBBs](../riaps-x86runtime/README.md#securecomm) instructions.  Once this process completes, the host environment will automatically login to the beaglebones when using ssh by utilizing your ssh keys.

8. Reboot the BBBs

# Update RIAPS Platform Packages on Existing BBBs

1. Download the [RIAPS update script](riaps_install_bbb.sh) to the BBB.

2. Stop the riaps_deplo service by running the kill script.

3. Run the update script.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install 'riaps-*' 2>&1 | tee install-riaps-update-bbb.log
```

# Helpful Hints

1. If you try 'scp' or 'ssh' and receive the following message, remove the '~/.ssh/known_host' file and try again.

```

# Available RIAPS Services

Current services loaded into the image on the BBB and on the host VM:

1. **riaps-deplo.service** - will start the RIAPS deployment application.  This service starts the RIAPS discovery service.  When enabled, this service is setup to restart if it fails.

   - this service is currently disabled on the VM by default
   - this service is currently enabled and started on the BBB by default

To see the status of a service or control its state, use the following commands manually on a command line, where name is the service name (like deplo).  Starting a service runs the actions immediately.  Enabling the service will allow the service to start when booting up.

```bash
sudo systemctl status riaps-<name>.service
sudo systemctl start riaps-<name>.service
sudo systemctl stop riaps-<name>.service
sudo systemctl enable riaps-<name>.service
sudo systemctl disable riaps-<name>.service
```
