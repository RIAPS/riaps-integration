This a generic application to test that the development environment is setup and able to talk with the configured RIAPS Nodes.  

## First Test VM with application on local node (VM)
1. Open 2 terminal windows and run the following command in the separate windows

   * ``` riaps_ctrl ```

   * ``` sudo -E riaps_deplo ```

2. With the 'riaps_ctrl' command, the RIAPS control GUI will come up.  The IP address of the host VM is added as a node.

3. In the control GUI, select the **WeatherMonitor** located under **~/env_setup_tests** folder.  Under the same folder select the **Model** file (.riaps) and deployment (**Depl**) file using the **wmonitor_vm_only.depl** file.  Then **Deploy** (button on the right) and click on the loaded WeatherMonitor application to **Launch** it.

4. When launching this application, the following is output on the RIAPS control GUI and from the different windows.

```

5.  Halt the application using the RIAPS control GUI.  Select the application button (WeatherMonitor) and choose **Halt**.  The application can also be restarted by selecting **Launch** again.

6.  When work with this application is complete, use the RIAPS control GUI to **Remove** the application.

## Second Test that a Single RIAPS Node Talks with the VM
1.  SSH into the RIAPS Node, where xxxx refers to the hostname seen when logged into the RIAPS Node.  Or use the IP address instead (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx).

    ```       
    ssh riaps@riaps-xxxx.local

    ```

2.  On the VM, open a terminal windows and run the following command in the separate windows

    ``` riaps_ctrl ```

3.  The RIAPS Node will automatically run ``` riaps_deplo ``` as a service.

4.  With the 'riaps_ctrl' command, the RIAPS control GUI will come up.  The IP address of the RIAPS Node is added as a node.

5.  Edit the **~/env_setup_tests/WeatherMonitor/wmonitor_1_node.depl** file to point to the RIAPS Node using either the hostname or the IP address.

6.  In the control GUI, select the **WeatherMonitor** located under **~/env_setup_tests** folder using the **wmonitor_1_node.depl** file.

7.  When the application is launched, the same output as indicate in the VM only test will be available.


## Third Test that Multiple RIAPS Nodes can Talk with the VM
1.  SSH into the RIAPS Nodes, where xxxx refers to the hostname seen when logging into the RIAPS Nodes.

    ``` ssh riaps@riaps-xxxx.local ```

2.  On the VM, open a terminal windows and run the following command

    ``` riaps_ctrl ```

3.  The RIAPS Node will automatically run ``` riaps_deplo ``` as a service.

4.  With the 'riaps_ctrl' command, the RIAPS control GUI will come up.  You should see the IP address of your RIAPS Nodes added as different nodes.

5.  The **~/env_setup_tests/WeatherMonitor/wmonitor_many_nodes.depl** file is setup to have a single RIAPS Node be the WeatherReceiver and then all RIAPS Nodes will report a temperature number (WeatherIndicator).  Edit this file to point the WeatherReceiver to one of the RIAPS Nodes using either the hostname or the IP address.

6.  In the control GUI, select the **WeatherMonitor** located under **~/env_setup_tests** folder using the **wmonitor_many_nodes.depl** file.

7.  When launching this application, the following outputs on the RIAPS control GUI and RIAPS Nodes application information.

     * For RIAPS Node that is only a WeatherIndicator, which is at 192.168.1.104

   ## Viewing the Application Model

   To understand an application and how the model ports are connected, use the **View** button on the far right of the RIAPS Control GUI.  For the WeatherMonitor application, the model view will look as follows:
